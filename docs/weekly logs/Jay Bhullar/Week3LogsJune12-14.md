### Comments ###

This week, I concentrated on enhancing the navigation bar and developing the UI components, which are crucial for our application's usability. Additionally, I worked extensively on the login page and the instructor dashboard, integrating necessary features and ensuring a smooth user experience. My efforts also involved learning and applying React.js and Node.js components. Moving forward, my goal is to continue developing the full frontend of our application and ensure it is fully functional by next week.
