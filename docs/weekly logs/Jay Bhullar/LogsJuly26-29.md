### Comments ###

This week, I focused mainly on fixing errors and implementing the student invitation functionality. Unfortunately, I was very ill with a high fever since Friday, which significantly limited my productivity. I apologize to my team for not being able to contribute as much as I would have liked. Despite this, I collaborated with Nic on planning the implementation of the student invitation feature using Node Mailer.

### Cycle Goal Review 
Reflection: This cycle was challenging due to my illness, which hindered my ability to contribute fully. However, I managed to make some progress in fixing errors and planning the implementation of key features.

Retrospective: The illness was an unforeseen setback, but I am committed to making up for the lost time in the coming weeks.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Work on the signup page and invitation features.
  * Complete all pending tasks before August 2nd.
