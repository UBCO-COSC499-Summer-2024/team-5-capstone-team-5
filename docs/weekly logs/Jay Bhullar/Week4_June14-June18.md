### Comments ###

This week, I concentrated on enhancing the navigation bar and developing the UI components, which are crucial for our application's usability. Additionally, I worked extensively on the login page and the instructor dashboard, integrating necessary features and ensuring a smooth user experience. My efforts also involved learning and applying React.js and Node.js components. Moving forward, my goal is to continue developing the full frontend of our application and ensure it is fully functional by next week.

### Cycle Goal Review 
Reflection: I completed the task of improving the Nav Bar and creating UI components as planned. However, the Login Page and Instructor Dashboard are taking longer than expected due to their complexity and integration challenges.

Retrospective: The process is going well, but we need to allocate more time for testing and integration to avoid delays in future cycles.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Make Instructor Dashboard fully functional
  * Add course, tests, edit, remove and view student lists functionalities
