### Comments ###

This period was intensive as I focused on setting up Docker and ensuring the frontend was operational. The Docker setup was particularly time-consuming but critical for our application's infrastructure. I also contributed to the presentation by recording the voice-over. Moving forward, I will continue to refine the UI mockups and start working on the ER model and journey lines.
