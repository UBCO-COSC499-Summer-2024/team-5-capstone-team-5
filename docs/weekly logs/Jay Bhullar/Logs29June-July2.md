### Cycle Goal Review 
Reflection: This cycle involved extensive work on the Instructor Dashboard's test management features. I also made various UI improvements and addressed profile email display issues. 

Retrospective: I took some time to check with the backend stuff, which is still a learning process and consuming a significant amount of my time.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Finish all UI elements for the Instructor before MVP submission on Friday, July 4.
