### Cycle Goal Review 
Reflection: This cycle involved significant work on frontend fixes and ensuring the correct answers feature functions properly. While progress was made, some tasks took longer than anticipated due to their complexity.

Retrospective: The focus on fixing existing issues was necessary to ensure a stable application. Moving forward, balancing between new development and fixing existing issues will be key.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Develop PDF converter.
  * Move forward with developing the app and the rest of the use cases as initially planned.
