# Week 2: June 5 - June 7

### Date: June 7
### Author: Jay Bhullar

## Breakdown

**Approximate Hours: 6.5**

### Things worked on: ###

- Docker setup (2 hours, medium). Set up Docker for the project, which involved configuring Docker images for the back end (Node.js / Express.js) and the database (PostgreSQL).

- FrontEnd MockUI (4.5 hours, large). Created mockups for the front-end UI using Figma, following the use cases defined in the project.


### Comments ###

This week, I focused on setting up Docker and creating frontend UI mockups, which are critical for our development process. The Docker setup was challenging but essential for our application's infrastructure. I will continue refining the UI mockups and start working on the ER model and journey lines in the upcoming days.
