### Cycle Goal Review 
Reflection: This cycle involved a heavy focus on frontend testing and fixing due to the backlog in testing and my recent illness. The efforts have resulted in many passed tests, though some areas still require work.

Retrospective: The concentrated effort on testing was necessary to ensure the stability and quality of the frontend. Moving forward, maintaining a balance between development and testing will be crucial.

### Next Cycle Goals
  * Move forward with developing the app and the rest of the use cases as initially planned.
