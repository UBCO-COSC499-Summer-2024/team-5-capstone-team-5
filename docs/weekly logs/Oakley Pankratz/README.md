### Worked on: ###

- Reviewing code (sm, 2 hours) I reviewed the design Docs, to make sure there weren't any typos, as well as Jay's code to try and understand it. Reviewing Jay's code took the bulk of this time.

- Resolving a bug on my local machine to get Docker working (sm, 2 hours) My local machine was having a problem with running the backend. Nick and I worked to resolve this bug. 

- Reviewing Tech (med, 3 hours) Since I have never taken a web development course, I have minimal understanding of the languages and frameworks in out tech stak. I reviewed HTML (3 hours), Javascript (3 hours) and React (4 hours.) 

- Meeting (very small, 1 hour) met with teamates to discuss our branching and logging.

 ### Work in Progress ###

 - Front End Devlopment: Speciffically, I plan to work on the Header and Footer (issues 46 & 47 on the Kanban board)

### Comments ###

This week felt a bit frustrating. As I reviewed teammates code, I realized my understanding of our tech stack wasn't good enough. Hacing to spend hours watching tutorials on youtube felt like "busy work" as I wasn't actually writing code. However, I believe this is an investment of time, as it should make development smoother for the rest of the term.

## Approximate Hours: 22
### Worked on: ###

- UI design in FIGMA (Very large, 18 hours) spent about 4-5 hours a day dedicated to our UI mockups. I worked closely with Nic. Togetehr, we refind the appearance a number of times, and simulated the majority of major functionality. 

- ER Diagram (small, 3 hours) Discussed the design of our ER Diagram with teammates (Mostly Nick, and a bit with Nathan as well in a team meeting). We revisted some notes from COSC 304 to ensure our diagram made sense.

- Design Docs (very small 1 hour) breifly reviewd the design docs to ensure everything that I didn't work on makes sense.

 ### Work in Progress ###

 - Further review our design docs, so we can be successful once we get to coding.

 - UI video presentation. Since I was heavily involved in the UI design, I may have a larger role to play in the video recording for the UI design.


### Comments ###

Nicholas and I worked very hard to get a very good looking UI mock-up. I need to spend more time studying the rest of our design planning such as the data flow diagrams, use cases, and ER diagram.

This week I got sick and that made it fairly difficult for me to contribute as much as I would've liked to. I plan to make up for this in the following weeks.
