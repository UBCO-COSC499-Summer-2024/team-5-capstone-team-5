# Week 1: June 7 - June 11

### Date: June 11
### Author: Oakley Pankratz

## Breakdown

**Approximate Hours: 15**

### Things wored on: ###

- Reviewing code (sm, 2 hours) I reviewed the design Docs, to make sure there weren't any typos, as well as Jay's code to try and understand it. Reviewing Jay's code took the bulk of this time.

- Resolving a bug on my local machine to get Docker working (sm, 2 hours) My local machine was having a problem with running the backend. Nick and I worked to resolve this bug. 

- Reviewing Tech (med, 3 hours) Since I have never taken a web development course, I have minimal understanding of the languages and frameworks in out tech stak. I reviewed HTML (3 hours), Javascript (3 hours) and React (4 hours.) 

- Meeting (very small, 1 hour) met with teamates to discuss our branching and logging.

 ### Work in Progress ###

 - Front End Devlopment: Speciffically, I plan to work on the Header and Footer (issues 46 & 47 on the Kanban board)

### Comments ###

This week felt a bit frustrating. As I reviewed teammates code, I realized my understanding of our tech stack wasn't good enough. Hacing to spend hours watching tutorials on youtube felt like "busy work" as I wasn't actually writing code. However, I believe this is an investment of time, as it should make development smoother for the rest of the term.
