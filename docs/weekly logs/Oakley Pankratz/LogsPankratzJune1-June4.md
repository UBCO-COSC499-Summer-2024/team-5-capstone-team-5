# Week 1: June 1 - June 4

### Date: June 5
### Author: Oakley Pankratz

## Breakdown

**Approximate Hours: 22**

### Things wored on: ###

- UI design in FIGMA (Very large 18 hours) spent about 4-5 hours a day dedicated to our UI mockups. I worked closely with Nic. Togetehr, we refind the appearance a number of times, and simulated the majority of major functionality. 

- ER Diagram (small, 3 hours) Discussed the design of our ER Diagram with teammates (Mostly Nick, and a bit with Nathan as well in a team meeting). We revisted some notes from COSC 304 to ensure our diagram made sense.

- Design Docs (very small 1 hour) breifly reviewd the design docs to ensure everything that I didn't work on makes sense.

 ### Work in Progress ###

 - Further review our design docs, so we can be successful once we get to coding.

 - UI video presentation. Since I was heavily involved in the UI design, I may have a larger role to play in the video recording for the UI design.


### Comments ###

Nicholas and I worked incredibly hard to get a very good looking UI mock-up. I need to spend more time studying the rest of our design planning such as the data flow diagrams, use cases, and ER diagram.

#### Hours worked by team members ###

- Jack: 2 (Did nothing outside of meetings)
- Nick: 25-30 (Nick worked incredibly hard this week. He is by far contributing the most)
- Nathan: 10-15 Completed Sufficient work outside of meetings.
- Jay: 10-15 Completed Sufficient work outside of meetings.
- Oakley: 22 It was a big stretch to learn FIGMA, I probably could've used less time had I known FIGMA prior.
