## Goal Recap

My goals for this week were to get the UI pages at least all in a prototype, complete our design document and diagrams, and set up Docker images for our backend and database.
We managed to get the UI finished and complete the design document requirements, but we were not able to get all of the Docker images up.

My goals for next week are to create our design video and setup Docker images for the backend and database, and start getting some code written for routing and React, with a general database design created in our Docker image with PostgreSQL
