## Overview:

Since Friday,
- Oakley added the ability to edit user's responses in his grades spreadsheet
- Nic worked on the OMR. He made it so the OMR handles multi-answer questions better and the scans now display on the frontend and save for students and instructors
- Jay worked on the styling of the frontend, to incorporate user feedback in the student's view
- Jack worked on the admin view that will show statistics and allow for the creation of instructor accounts
