## Test Report / Testing Status:

![Testing Status](../logScreenshots/droneTestStatusWeek6.2.png)
Testing was worked on, but something is wrong with our DroneCI I think. It is saying we need a license?

## Overview:

Since Wednesday,
* Nic finished getting the OMR tied into the backend and database, created a CSV parsing function on the backend that takes in a CSV file upload from the frontend and inputs the student data into the database, and worked on some of the frontend integration with backend.
* Jay worked on UI and tied in the 'Add Exam' button to the backend, as well as showing the answer key to the instructor.
* Oakley worked on the frontend table to display user grade data to the instructors and went through a bunch of the codebase to get caught up on what needs to be completed.

* Collectively, we 3 worked on our MVP presentation for quite a long time.
