## Overview:

This week, the team focused on setting up our OMR container (WIP), and creating the instructor view (WIP), as these are the two main componenets of our system. Apart from that, there was a lot of troubleshooting and learning involved with getting things running correctly.

The next cycle will focus on working towards getting an OMR container running, adding instructor's ability to add, modify and delete courses, exams, and students, adding a student grades table, and an instructor's exam list, as well as getting automated unit testing and integration testing via DroneCI.

By Friday, we plan to have the ability to add courses and exams to the system and view the exam list, as well as progress towards our automated testing.
