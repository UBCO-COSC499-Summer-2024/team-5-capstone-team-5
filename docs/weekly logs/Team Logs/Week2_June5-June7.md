We need to get our Node/Express container and our PostgreSQL container up

Basic journey line to outline the pain points that a user might experience with our system. This will allow us to more effectively narrow our focus to key components of the system

### Tasks still WIP This Cycle:

# Task Write-Up
We did a fair amount of work on Wednesday night to get our design document submitted on time. This left no time to work on getting the core Docker components for our system up, but we plan to have that done early in this upcoming cycle.

As well as that, we are in the process of making our design presentation in order to get our video submitted for Friday
