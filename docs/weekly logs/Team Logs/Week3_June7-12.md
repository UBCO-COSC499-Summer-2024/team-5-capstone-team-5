# Task Write-Up
We did a fair amount of work on Wednesday night to get our design document submitted on time. This left no time to work on getting the core Docker components for our system up, but we plan to have that done early in this upcoming cycle.

As well as that, we are in the process of making our design presentation in order to get our video submitted for Friday
