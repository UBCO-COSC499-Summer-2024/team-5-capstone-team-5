# Features of the Plan Cycle
- ### Docker images up and running 
We need to get our Node/Express container and our PostgreSQL container up

Basic journey line to outline the pain points that a user might experience with our system. This will allow us to more effectively narrow our focus to key components of the system
- ### Get all services connected basically
OMR service container should be started with a basic Clerk auth connected to a React front-end by Wednesday

# Task Write-Up
We completed the design video. We got our Docker image up, had multiple team meetings where we discussed branching, logging, and the work we were going to complete for this cycle. We also moved some of Jay's React work into the Docker frontend in order to get an idea of page layouts.

Nathan started work on some Postgres learning and is working on writing test user / course / exam data so we can create a dynamic React UI
