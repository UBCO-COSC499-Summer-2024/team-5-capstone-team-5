# Task Write-Up
We completed the design video. We got our Docker image up, had multiple team meetings where we discussed branching, logging, and the work we were going to complete for this cycle. We also moved some of Jay's React work into the Docker frontend in order to get an idea of page layouts.

Nathan started work on some Postgres learning and is working on writing test user / course / exam data so we can create a dynamic React UI
