## Test Report / Testing Status:

![Testing Status](../logScreenshots/droneTestStatusWeek6.png)
Testing has been set up, though only 15 tests are currently created and they are all on the backend. Same as previous week.

## Overview:

Since Friday, 
* Nic worked on getting an OMR image running using openCV in Python. This image is currently running when the system starts, and allows input of pdf files. It does analysis, but the output is not tied to the database yet. Nic also worked on helping Jay with some backend routing for creating new exams as an instructor.
* Jay developed front-end pages; Test desccription to show test information, implemented showing correct answers, editing tests, deleting tests, fixed the profile display to show email, and did minor UI tweaks.
